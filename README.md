# Description
My first portfolio website. I decided that minimalistic look of the homepage and info section needs to be balanced with something colorful to show some of my personality. To achieve that I used JS and HTML canvas to display cursor trail that changes color on each page. I also included a CSS drawing of a cat on the contact page that hits the table whenever user hovers over any of the contact links. 

I plan on updating my portfolio website in the future with possibly displaying gifs for my projects on work page and generating GitHub API tokens programmitacily to increase the amount of API calls per hour limit for my page.

# Key features
- HTML canvas are used for cursor trail that changes color.
- Serves GitHub API data to display latest follower, latest commit and latest created repository.
- Features an animated CSS drawing of üêæ a cat.
- Responsiveness. Works on any screen.
